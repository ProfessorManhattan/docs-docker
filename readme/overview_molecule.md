## Overview

[Ansible Molecule]({{ website.ansible_molecule_docs }}) testing is a critical part of creating Ansible roles that are meant for public consumption. Nearly all of [our Ansible roles]({{ repository.group.ansible_roles }}) support Archlinux, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, Mac OS X, and Windows. On top of that, we have hundreds of roles to maintain. In order to alleviate the headache that comes with supporting so many operating systems and so many roles, we utilize several test methods which are all powered by Ansible Molecule. In particular, we use this image to test {{ pretty_name }} using GitLab CI. This allows us to spot some bugs before the software is released as open source. Granted, we do use other tests that are compatible with Mac OS X/Windows and better simulate potential install environments. However, this repository is part of our first line of defense when it comes to preventing regressions on supported Linux environments.
