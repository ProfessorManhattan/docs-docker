## Requirements

Before getting started with development, you should ensure that the following requirements are present on your system:

* **[Docker]({{ repository.project.docker }})**
* **[Dockerslim]({{ repository.project.dockerslim }})** - Used for generating compact, secure images
* **[Node.js]({{ repository.project.node }})** (*Version >=10*) - Utilized to add development features like a pre-commit hook and other automations

*Each of the requirements links to an Ansible Role that can install the dependency with a one-line bash script install.*
