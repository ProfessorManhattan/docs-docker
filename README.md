# Dockerfile Documentation

This repository contains documentation partials written in Markdown. The partials are used for generating the documentation for our various [Dockerfile repositories](https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/dockerfile).

You can rebuild the documentation by running the following command in one of our Dockerfile repositories:

```shell
bash .start.sh
```

Changes made to this repository will automatically propagate to our Dockerfile projects via GitLab CI.
